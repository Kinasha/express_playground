## pre-works
I will use [SwitchHosts](https://github.com/oldj/SwitchHosts/releases) to change local host file , to get a customized dns parsing result
so you may need install it first to run this demo

cant work because of local host file cant reflect port ,we must declare port number in src attribute ,so it will be block by the CORS policy .
